* Geometric Metaphors
Imagine, if you will, a metaphor of sorts.

A man drives in a very expensive Humvee across the American Midwest.
The driver, a producer of intense industrial techno—a niche but oddly
lucrative subgenre—worn out from decades of substance abuse, gets lost
and asks the way from a farmer, conveniently placed in the middle of
these enormous plains. The driver asks the way. The farmer gently
explains there is no way to go to point C from here. From A to B is
fine; point C is not possible. Geometry disallows it. Angered, the
driver plows full steam ahead, only to discover the farmer was
correct.

Now imagine, if you will, another metaphor of sorts.

There is a man in our midst; he’s slightly better than us. Earns
slightly better, has a slightly happier life overall. He explains to
us he is the Judas Man, analogous to the Judas goat that leads his
herd to the slaughter. He is blessed in this way by our secret
overlords that feast on the lives we live, but sometimes we need a
little bit of encouragement from our peers to get the taste just
right.

Judas Man explains there’s really no way out. You can try all you want
to escape the fold with rebellious tattoos, punk hairdo, breaking
taboos, or other ways to be special. All you can ever come up with is
within the well-known limits and acceptable parameter variations.
Judas Man fills no purpose, but he doesn't mind.

There’s simply no fucking around with the laws of geometry.

Final metaphor: Imagine I'm a guru, a priest, an autocratic
businessman. I'm a path to your god. I offer a way out via the
infinite, which suffers not from the stifling boundaries of geometry.
I am to you what a sphere is to a square. You live in the flatlands,
and I in the higher dimensions. Or, that’s what I give the appearance
of. Perhaps there is a way out, but do you really need me to help you
find out? \vspace{1.5cm}
