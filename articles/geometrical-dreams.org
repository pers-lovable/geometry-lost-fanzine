* Geometrical Dreams

Geometrical Dreams - what are they and why do we want them? These
questions were answered by the demo group
The Silents on a fateful day, June 15th, 1991, at the
Eskilstuna Computer Entertainment Show (ECES), where they
entered the demo competition with a dentro with this name.

A dentro is a rare type of production classified somewhere between a
demo and an intro, and Geometrical Dreams has a run time of about five minute - quite
typical for such productions. It was created for Amiga OCS, teasing the
audience with a glimpse of the forthcoming demo, Power and Glory (a
legend whispered but never realized).

It was made at a time when the spectacle of rotating vector objects,
3D models rendered using polygons - was very popular, and The Silents
chose a big vector ball as the pièce de résistance - in its zoomed in view
it fills the whole screen at a decent frame rate. They explained that
the vector routine was still unoptimized, and could be sped up by at
least 10%. The overall dentro composition consists of transitioning
between a vector object, showing a bitmap picture and showing
information text and greetings.

A nice, geometrical detail is the vector object representing the
group's name abbreviation, TSL. Its shape is reproduced here in ASCII:

#+begin_example
##### ######
    # #    #
    # #### #
    #    # #
    ###### #####

#+end_example

The music is what I liked the most about the demo. It is in typical The
Silents style, and has a catchy melody with instruments I seem to
recall from other productions by the group.

Now, as we ponder the legacy of this dream, what implications does it
hold nowadays? True, The Silents themselves downplay its
significance, deeming it a spontaneous creation, born in the crucible
of three days and assembled from scattered fragments. Yet, it clinched
the second spot in the competition, leaving an indelible mark on those
who beheld its splendor.

With that said, it is still a nice dentro to watch today in the style
of its time, and I even remember the tune today, from hearing it back
in 1991.
