* Geometrical Dreams

Geometrical Dreams - what are they and why do we want them? These
questions were answered by the demo group
The Silents on a fateful day, June 15th, 1991, at the
Eskilstuna Computer Entertainment Show (ECES), where they
entered the demo competition with a dentro with this name.

A dentro is a rare type of production classified somewhere between a
demo and an intro, and Geometrical Dreams has a run time of about five
minute - quite typical for such productions. It was created for Amiga
OCS, as a precursor of the planned, forthcoming demo, Power and Glory
(which was never released but that is another story).

It was made at a time when rotating vector objects,
3D models rendered using polygons - was very popular, and The Silents
chose a big vector ball as the pièce de résistance - in its zoomed in view
it fills the whole screen at a decent frame rate. They explained that
the vector routine was still unoptimized, and could be sped up by at
least 10%. The overall dentro composition consists of transitioning
between a vector object, showing a bitmap picture and showing
information text and greetings.

A nice, geometrical detail is the symmetric vector object representing
the group's name abbreviation, TSL. Its shape is reproduced here in
ASCII:

#+begin_example
                ##### ######
                    # #    #
                    # #### #
                    #    # #
                    ###### #####
#+end_example

The music is what I liked the most about the demo. It is in typical The
Silents style, and has a catchy melody with instruments I seem to
recall from other productions by the group.

Decades later, as we ponder the legacy of this dream, what
implications does it hold nowadays? True, The Silents themselves
downplay its significance, deeming it a spontaneous creation, born in
the crucible of three days and assembled from scattered
fragments. Yet, it achieved the honourable second place in the competition.

It is still a nice dentro to watch today in the style of its time, and
I even remember the tune today, from hearing it back in 1991.
