#+BEGIN_VERSE
I open the front door and step into the house
The foyer presents itself as an ordinary entrance
Something feels subtly off
I move forward into the living room
The furniture shifts slightly in the corner of my eyes
The wallpaper patterns stretch and contract
Now I'm in the kitchen
Strangely, when I turn a corner I'm in the foyer again
I retrace my steps hoping to find the living room
Instead I'm in a bedroom I've never seen before
The disorientation grows stronger as I explore further
Now I'm in a hallway where doors lead to entirely new wings of the house
Opening one door I step into a garden
I close the door and find myself in a study
Every room feels connected to multiple others in ways I don't understand
The staircase winds endlessly upward, yet I revisit places I've already been
The house's geography makes no sense
Each room exists in its own little pocket universe connected
In ways my mind struggles to comprehend
As hours turn into days and days into unknowable stretches of time
My mind can in the end only hold one thought
To finally find the front door and step out into the blessed outside
