#+BEGIN_VERSE
I open the front door and step into the house
The foyer presents itself as an ordinary entrance
something feels subtly off
I move forward into the living room
the furniture  shifts slightly in the corner of my eyes
The wallpaper patterns stretch and contract
Now Im in the kitchen
Strangely when I turn a corner Im in the foyer again
I retrace my steps hoping to find the living room
Instead Im  in a bedroom Ive never seen before
The disorientation grows stronger as I explore further
Now Im in a hallway where doors lead to entirely new wings of the house
Opening one door I step into  a garden
I close the door and find myself in a study
Every room feels connected to multiple others in  ways I dont understand
The staircase winds endlessly upward yet I revisit places Ive already been
The houses geography makes no sense
each room exists in its own little pocket universe connected in
ways my  mind struggles to comprehend
As hours turns into days and days into unknowable stretches of time
my mind can in the end ony hold one thought
to finaly find the front door and step out into the blessed outside
