* Retro production review

Geometrical Dreams - what are they and why do we want them? These
questions were answered by the demo group The Silents in 15 June
1991 at the Eskilstuna Computer Entertainment Show (ECES), where they
entered the demo competition with a dentro with this name.

A dentro is a rare type of production classified somewhere between a
demo and an intro, and GD has a run time of about five minute - quite
typical for such productions. It was created for Amiga OCS, and was
made as a taste of a forth coming demo called Power and Glory (which
as far as I know never saw the light of day).

It was made in an age when showcasing rotating vector objects - 3d
models rendered using polygons - was very popular, and The Silents
chose a big vector ball as the main attraction - in its zoomed in view
it fills the whole screen at a decent frame rate. They explain that
the vector routine is still unoptimized, and can be sped up by at
least 10%. The overall dentro composition consists of transitioning
between a vector object, showing a bitmap picture and showing
information text and greetings.

A nice, geometrical detail is the vector object representing the
group's name abbreviation, TSL:

#+begin_verse
12345##### ######
    # #    #
    # #### #
    #    # #
    ###### #####

#+end_verse

The music is what I liked the most about the demo. It is in typical The
Silents style, and has a catchy melody with instruments I seem to
recall from other productions by the group.

So can we make any sense of these dreams? What it is the legacy of
this dentro, and does it have any implications in the year 2022? As the
group members say themselves, it is not meant to be a big milestone -
they claim it was made in three days with bits lying around, and in
the competition it ended up in second place. With that said, it is
still a nice dentro to watch today in the style of its time, and I
even remember the tune today, from hearing it back in 1991. For all of
us who long for a final geometrical dream in our life, this splash of
colour and bold four track sound is a technological sparkler, albeit a
modest one.
