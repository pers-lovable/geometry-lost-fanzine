* Geometric Reverie in the Early 90's Demo Scene

Ever wondered about the allure of Geometrical Dreams? The demo group
The Silents sure did on a fateful day, June 15th, 1991, at the
Eskilstuna Computer Entertainment Show (ECES). There, amidst the
fervor of the demo competition, they unveiled their masterpiece - a
dentro like no other.

A dentro, that elusive creation nestled between a demo and an intro,
emerged into the limelight with Geometrical Dreams, or GD for the
initiated. With a runtime of approximately five minutes - a standard
for such marvels - GD was tailored for the Amiga OCS, teasing the
audience with a glimpse of the forthcoming demo, Power and Glory (a
legend whispered but never realized).

Picture this: a time when the spectacle of rotating vector objects,
those 3D marvels birthed from polygons, held sway over the hearts of
enthusiasts. The Silents, in their wisdom, chose a grand vector ball
as the pièce de résistance, dominating the screen with its hypnotic
gyrations. Though they confessed their vector routine remained
unoptimized, hinting at a hidden potential for speed enhancement, it
hardly detracted from the overall spectacle.

But let's not overlook the finer details. Here is the fully
symmetrical representation of the group's insignia, TSL, an ode to The
Silents' legacy:

Ah, the music! A symphony in the unmistakable style of The Silents,
weaving a tapestry of melodies that echo through the corridors of
time. Each note a whisper from the past, invoking memories of
productions long cherished.

Now, as we ponder the legacy of this dream, what implications does it
hold in the year 2022? True, The Silents themselves downplay its
significance, deeming it a spontaneous creation, born in the crucible
of three days and assembled from scattered fragments. Yet, it clinched
the second spot in the competition, leaving an indelible mark on those
who beheld its splendor.

For those of us who yearn for one last geometric reverie, GD stands as
a beacon of hope. Its vibrant hues and resounding four-track symphony
serve as a testament to the technological marvels of yore, a modest
sparkler illuminating the path toward artistic transcendence.
